# Readme for ARC20 Contract

Discord 0zerolink#1115

## Overview
The `arc20` program is a smart contract designed for the Aleo blockchain that implements token management functions similar to the ERC20 standard in Ethereum, tailored for privacy-focused operations.

## Features
- **Token Management**: Users can transfer public and private tokens, check balances, and authorize others to spend tokens on their behalf.
- **Privacy Preservation**: Offers private transfers that keep sender's information confidential, and public-to-private transfers that conceal the receiver's details.

## Functions
- `approve`: Authorizes a spender to use a specific token amount from the caller's account.
- `transfer`: Transfers tokens from the caller to another public account.
- `transfer_from`: Transfers tokens from one public account to another, if authorized.
- `transfer_private`: Transfers tokens privately, revealing no details about the sender or receiver.
- `transfer_private_to_public`: Converts private tokens to public for the receiver, revealing the receiver's details.
- `transfer_public_to_private`: Converts public tokens to private for the receiver, revealing the sender's details.

## Usage
To use this smart contract, users must call the corresponding transition functions with the necessary parameters. Example inputs for each function are provided in the program input section.
